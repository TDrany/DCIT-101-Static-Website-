            <h2><b>What Is Grime Music?</b></h2>

            
            <h2></h2>

            <h3><p>Grime is an eclectic style of British rap music that emerged in London in the early 2000s. 
                Evolving from the UK garage music scene of the 1990s in London, grime music also includes hip hop, rap, and hardcore techno influences. 
                Grime music is characterized by fast beats, electronic sounds, UK accents, and frenetic energy. 
                The grime music scene is made up of grime crews, collectives of musicians that produce music together and perform at nightlife venues, often those that are small-scale or “underground.”</p></h3>
